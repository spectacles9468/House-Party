#Birthday Party Virtual Reality Experience

Project Description:
Built a Virtual Reality Website using Aframe. Aframe includes a preset environment which can give a base environment to our project or we will be creating a custom environment. 
These days research in the metaverse has made the VR market much more desirable. Web Virtual Reality makes it possible for anyone with a device that has a browser on it to enjoy a Virtual reality experience. Our project is a  house birthday party with at least 3 rooms to interact in. Our main challenge would be to provide motion in different entities and make sure that the room experience is seamless.
Methodology:
Technology: A-Frame is a three.js framework with an entity-component-system (ECS) architecture. The ECS architecture has entities that are made up of components that can be assigned certain attributes. The system executes queries to take action on entities. We will be using the XAMPP local server to test our website. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible. 

Using all the technologies and software mentioned above, we will be able to create a virtual house party that is interactive and fun. Our aim would be to make sure that our clients are interactive will all the elements present in the rooms.
